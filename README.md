# Optimized Hardware-Software Co-Design for Kyber and Dilithium on Multi-Core RISC-V SoC FPGA Platform

This repository provides implementations of Kyber and Dilithium based on Polarfire SoC FPGA platform. Each algorithm is implemented in three different ways:

- Baseline implementation on a single core
- Code optimization on a single core with hardware acceleration
- Code optimization on multiple cores with hardware acceleration
